# FormBuilderBundle

FormBuilderBundle is my first Symfony2 Plugin, and it's a concept portage of
spyFormBuilder2Plugin to ease make a form generator for CMS.

This Bundle will be completly rewrited using Symfony2 Bundles and some other 
standards.

# How to Install

Add this route :

_adminformbuilder:
    resource: "@FormBuilderBundle/Controller/AdminController.php"
    type:     annotation
    prefix:   /form-builder

2) In your AppKernel add

$bundles[] = new Lombardot\FormBuilderBundle\FormBuilderBundle();

3) In autoload register :
